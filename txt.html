        <p>When fans hear Iron Man, the only actor that comes to mind is Robert Downey Jr.Downey       spearheaded the Marvel Cinematic Universe 
           when he debuted as the Armored Avenger in Jon Favreau's Iron Man back in 2008. 
           The film's success then made it clear that Marvel was working towards something big, and it was ultimately revealed that 
           the plan was to assemble the Avengers on the big screen. 
        
            After Iron Man, Downey reprised his role ten times over eleven years in films like The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.
            The MCU veteran capped off his run during Endgame, with Tony Stark sacrificing his life to save the universe against Josh Brolin's Thanos. 
            As the MCU moves on from Iron Man, an emotional letter from Downey was officially revealed in a special tie-in book for the franchise.
